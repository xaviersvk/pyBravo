CONNECT_DOC = """
Opens a connection to the configured Bravo. This does NOT initialize the instrument.

What this operation does:
- Opens the configured controller transport for simulation, Agile, or Darwin.
- Stores the selected address or port back into the active profile when possible.
- Performs connection-level setup only: per-axis parameter access, clearing stale
  instruction tables, and caching each axis's peak-current reference.

What it does NOT do:
- No ping, firmware check, or controller-identity verification.
- No safety-interlock check, motor-power-fault clear, or fault reset.
- No head or gripper detection, and no check for a plate left in the gripper.
- No homing. Every axis position is unknown until the instrument is initialized.

Manual alignment:
- This is the API equivalent of selecting a device and opening communications
  with it. The separate **Initializing the device** workflow is
  POST /api/initialize.

When to use it:
- Call this first, then POST /api/initialize before commanding any motion.
- After a connection drops, reconnecting alone is not enough — an instrument that
  was power-cycled needs initializing again.

INITIALIZE_DOC = """
Runs the Bravo device initialization sequence using the active profile.

What this operation does:
- Connects first if no active controller session exists.
- Verifies the controller can communicate.
- Performs the standard initialization task sequence used by PyBravo for real hardware or simulation.

Manual alignment:
- This is the API equivalent of the manual's **Initializing the device** workflow.
- It prepares the robot for later motion, teachpoint work, tip handling, and diagnostics-style tasks.

Notes:
- Initialization behavior depends on the active profile, including connection type, head settings, and safety preferences.
- If no Bravo address is configured for an Ethernet controller, the request is rejected.
""".strip()

TEACHPOINT_DOC = """
Teachpoints define the reference X, Y, and Z coordinates for each deck location.

What this endpoint family is for:
- Reading the current taught coordinates for a location.
- Writing explicit coordinates into the teachpoint store.
- Capturing the robot's current position as the teachpoint for a location.

Manual alignment:
- This maps directly to the manual's **Setting teachpoints** workflow.
- In Bravo usage, later commands such as Move, Approach, Tips On, Pick and Place, Aspirate, and Dispense all depend on correctly taught deck positions.

Important behavior:
- The `teach_current` form uses the live robot position and stores it as the new location reference.
- The stored values become the base coordinates used by task-level APIs.
""".strip()

MOVE_LOCATION_DOC = """
Moves the head to a taught deck location using the teachpoint reference for that location.

What this operation does:
- Uses the saved X and Y coordinates for the location.
- Uses the saved Z coordinate as the full taught position.
- Can optionally stop above the deck by applying an approach height rather than going all the way to the taught Z.

Manual alignment:
- This matches the diagnostics and command concepts around **Move** and **Approach**.
- It is the API equivalent of sending the head to a known taught location during setup, troubleshooting, or single-step task execution.

Typical use cases:
- Verifying that teachpoints are correct.
- Moving safely over a plate or tip box before a more specific task.
- Driving UI navigation actions that need the head over a selected deck position.

Prerequisites:
- The location must already have a valid teachpoint.
- The robot should be initialized and homed.
- The active profile should contain the correct safe-Z and speed behavior for the installed hardware.

Sequence:
1. Retract Z to safe height.
2. Move X and Y to the taught location unless `only_move_z` is requested.
3. Lower Z either to the taught Z or to an approach height above the taught Z.

Common failure cases:
- Missing or incorrect teachpoints.
- Safety interlock or disabled robot state.
- Profile/controller mismatch that makes the move invalid for the installed machine.
""".strip()

SAFE_Z_DOC = """
Retracts the liquid-handling Z axis to the configured safe-Z position.

What this operation does:
- Moves only the Z axis.
- Uses the configured safe clearance from the active profile.
- Provides vertical clearance before XY travel over deck labware or accessories.

Manual alignment:
- This reflects the same safe-clearance behavior operators expect before jogging or moving across deck locations.
- In practical Bravo use, safe-Z is a protection step that reduces the chance of striking labware, tips, lids, or accessory hardware.
""".strip()

ASPIRATE_DOC = """
Runs an aspirate task at the specified taught location.

What this operation does:
- Moves to the selected location using teachpoint geometry.
- Lowers the head toward the working depth.
- Aspirates the requested volume using the current head and profile settings.

Manual alignment:
- This is the API equivalent of running an individual liquid-handling task rather than a full protocol.
- It aligns with the description that tasks can be run individually from diagnostics-style tooling.

Important assumptions:
- The location must already be taught.
- The selected head, tip state, and labware geometry must be compatible with the requested operation.

Prerequisites:
- The robot should be initialized and positioned with valid teachpoints.
- Compatible tips and head configuration must already be on the instrument.
- The location should represent the intended source well or container position.

Sequence:
1. Retract to safe height.
2. Move to the taught location.
3. Lower to the working depth derived from the request parameters.
4. Aspirate the requested volume.
5. Retract to a safe position after the liquid-handling step.

Common failure cases:
- Aspirating at a location with invalid teachpoint geometry.
- Missing tips or incompatible head configuration.
- Volumes or liquid-handling settings that do not match the selected setup.
""".strip()

DISPENSE_DOC = """
Runs a dispense task at the specified taught location.

What this operation does:
- Moves to the location using its teachpoint.
- Lowers toward the dispense depth.
- Dispenses the requested volume and completes the task under profile-controlled motion settings.

Manual alignment:
- This is the companion to aspirate for single-task execution.
- It corresponds to performing a fluid-transfer action directly, outside of a larger style protocol run.

Prerequisites:
- The robot should already hold the required liquid volume.
- The destination location must be taught correctly.
- The current head, tip, and deck configuration must be compatible with the destination labware.

Sequence:
1. Retract to safe height.
2. Move to the taught destination.
3. Lower to the requested dispense depth.
4. Dispense the requested volume.
5. Retract after the dispense completes.

Common failure cases:
- Incorrect teachpoint depth causing the dispense position to be wrong.
- Missing tips or incompatible head/labware configuration.
- Requested volume or optional settings not matching the current liquid-handling setup.
""".strip()

TIPS_ON_DOC = """
Runs the disposable-tip pickup task for the specified tip-box location.

What this operation does:
- Uses the active head mode to determine how many tips should be picked up.
- Uses the active tip-selection anchor when partial pickup is enabled.
- Moves to the taught tip-box location and performs the pickup motion.

Manual alignment:
- This maps to the manual's disposable-tip head behavior and to the Diagnostics concept of running **Tips On** as an individual task.
- It also reflects the model in which head mode and well accessibility determine which tips can be acquired.

Important behavior:
- Tip-box geometry and compatibility matter.
- Partial pickup depends on the selected subset configuration and legal anchor position.

Prerequisites:
- The selected location must contain compatible tip-box labware.
- The location teachpoint must be valid.
- The active head mode and tip selection must be legal for the tip box and installed head.

Sequence:
1. Retract to safe height.
2. Move to the tip-box location using the taught XY position and any head-mode offset.
3. Lower the head onto the selected tip pattern.
4. Complete the pickup motion and record the resulting tip state on the head.
5. Retract from the tip box.

Common failure cases:
- Tip box missing or wrong labware type at the location.
- Illegal anchor position for partial pickup.
- Head mode incompatible with the available rows, columns, or selected tips.
""".strip()

TIPS_OFF_DOC = """
Runs the disposable-tip unload or return task for the specified location.

What this operation does:
- Uses the stored on-head tip-selection state when tips are currently mounted.
- Moves to the selected return or discard location.
- Performs the unload sequence using the active head/tip context.

Manual alignment:
- This is the API equivalent of running **Tips Off** as an individual task from diagnostics-style controls.
- It follows the same Bravo model that tip return must respect accessible wells and current tip occupancy.

Prerequisites:
- Tips must currently be on the head.
- The destination location must be valid for the return or discard operation.
- Teachpoints and head-mode state must still match the tip pattern that is currently mounted.

Sequence:
1. Retract to safe height.
2. Move to the requested return or discard location.
3. Lower into the return/drop-off position.
4. Release or return the active tip pattern.
5. Update the stored on-head tip state and retract.

Common failure cases:
- No tips present on the head.
- Returning to a tip box location that cannot legally accept the active tip pattern.
- Invalid or stale teachpoint data for the target location.
""".strip()

PICK_PLACE_DOC = """
Runs a full gripper-based pick-and-place operation between two deck locations.

What this operation does:
- Retracts to a safe starting condition.
- Opens and positions the gripper.
- Moves to the source location, grips the labware, lifts to a carry height, travels to the destination, and releases the labware.
- Uses taught deck coordinates plus labware handling geometry such as stack height and gripper offset.

Manual alignment:
- This is the API equivalent of a manual gripper task sequence described in the diagnostics and gripper-control sections.
- It matches the Bravo expectation that plate handling depends on correct teachpoints, gripper setup, and deck geometry.

Why this is higher level than raw moves:
- The endpoint solves intermediate carry poses and safe transitions automatically.
- It returns diagnostic information about the solved pick, carry, and place positions.

Prerequisites:
- Source and destination locations must be taught correctly.
- Source location must contain labware that can be handled by the gripper.
- Gripper setup and offsets must be correct for the installed hardware and active profile.

Sequence:
1. Retract to a safe starting condition.
2. Open and nest the gripper as needed.
3. Move to the source location.
4. Lower to the computed pick pose and grip the labware.
5. Move to a carry height that clears nearby deck obstacles.
6. Travel to the destination location.
7. Lower to the computed place pose and release the labware.
8. Return the gripper to its nesting position.

Common failure cases:
- No labware present at the source location.
- Incorrect teachpoints or gripper offsets causing poor pickup alignment.
- Deck geometry, stack height, or obstacle clearance not matching the physical setup.
""".strip()

LABWARE_DOC = """
Labware definitions describe the type and geometry of the containers and consumables that Bravo devices handle during runs.

What this area of the API is for:
- Listing the runtime labware catalog used by PyBravo.
- Creating and editing labware entry definitions.
- Managing labware classes and associated 2D or 3D assets.

Manual alignment:
- This mirrors the manual's concept of **Define labware** before attempting automated tasks.
- Geometry, well layout, and handling properties drive deck rendering, accessibility checks, and motion planning.
""".strip()

PROFILE_DOC = """
Profiles store the robot configuration used by PyBravo for connection, head setup, tip options, and safety behavior.

What this area of the API is for:
- Listing saved profiles.
- Reading the active profile.
- Updating the active profile.
- Loading a different profile from disk.

Manual alignment:
- This corresponds to the setup workflow for **Creating and managing profiles**.
- Profiles are the persistent configuration layer that determines how later task and motion operations behave.
""".strip()

DISCOVERY_DOC = """
Discovers Bravo devices on the local network and lets the selected device be stored into the active profile.

What this area of the API is for:
- Scanning adapters and Bravo-relevant subnets.
- Using the UDP discovery handshake when available.
- Falling back to TCP probing when broadcast discovery does not return a device.
- Storing the chosen device address for later connect and initialize requests.

Manual alignment:
- This supports the same practical setup step as creating or adding a Bravo device before operation.
- It is especially useful in multi-device or newly provisioned environments where the Bravo address is not yet fixed in the profile.
""".strip()

HEAD_MODE_DOC = """
Head mode controls which subset of a disposable-tip head is considered active for later tip pickup, return, and liquid-handling operations.

What this endpoint family is for:
- Reading the currently active subset configuration.
- Setting row, column, rectangle, or full-head usage modes.
- Suggesting a starting mode based on the installed head and assigned labware.

Manual alignment:
- This extends the concept that disposable-tip heads can operate on all wells or on selected rows, columns, or smaller subsets depending on the task.
- It is especially relevant for partial tip pickup and serial-dilution style workflows where only part of the head should be active.

Important behavior:
- The chosen subset changes how XY offsets and accessible wells are calculated.
- The active mode is also used when validating tip selection and tip-box access.
""".strip()

TIP_SELECTION_DOC = """
Tip selection tracks the anchor well used for partial tip pickup and return.

What this endpoint family is for:
- Inspecting the currently selected tip anchor.
- Updating the anchor row and column for later tip tasks.

Manual alignment:
- This is the API expression of the operator decision about which subset of a tip box should line up with the active subset of the head.
- It matters whenever the full head is not being used.

Important behavior:
- The selection is validated against head mode, tip-box geometry, and accessibility rules.
- The same selection state is reused by later `Tips On` and `Tips Off` operations.
""".strip()

GRIPPER_DOC = """
These operations expose the gripper controls used for plate-handling diagnostics and gripper-based tasks.

What this endpoint family is for:
- Opening the gripper.
- Closing the gripper.
- Docking or recessing the gripper Z axis.

Manual alignment:
- This matches the diagnostics and gripper setup sections of the Bravo manual, where operators verify gripper behavior before relying on automated plate moves.

Important behavior:
- These are low-level plate-handling controls.
- Higher-level plate transfer behavior is implemented by the `pick_place` task endpoint.
""".strip()

EXECUTE_COMMAND_DOC = """
Executes a named high-level task through a single generic endpoint.

What this operation does:
- Dispatches to one of the supported task APIs such as aspirate, dispense, mix, tips on, tips off, stack plates, delid plate, or scan stack height.
- Lets clients issue one command shape while still using the underlying task engine.

Manual alignment:
- This is close to running an individual task from a diagnostics or command dialog rather than from a full protocol definition.

Important behavior:
- The `command` field determines which task is run.
- Optional liquid-class and pipette-technique parameters are forwarded when the selected task supports them.
""".strip()

LIQUID_CONTEXT_DOC = """
Returns the active liquid-handling context that PyBravo uses to resolve liquid classes.

What this operation does:
- Reports the active machine identifier, installed head type, active tip definition, and active tip capacity.
- Provides the context key used when filtering or selecting liquid classes.

Manual alignment:
- This reflects the Bravo reality that liquid-handling behavior depends on the machine, head, and tip combination in use.
- In terms of the model, liquid-class compatibility is not global; it depends on the physical configuration.

Typical use cases:
- Populating editor defaults.
- Explaining why a given liquid class appears or does not appear in the UI.
- Debugging context-sensitive aspirate and dispense behavior.

TIPS_CATALOG_DOC = """
Tip definitions describe the disposable tip consumables available to the system.

What this area of the API is for:

Manual alignment:
- The Bravo manual ties head behavior and compatibility closely to the installed tip type and volume.
- This API stores the corresponding software definitions used by PyBravo for tip length, capacity, compatibility, and optional visualization.

Important behavior:
- Tip definitions affect active liquid context, teach-tip calculations, compatibility checks, and liquid-class resolution.
""".strip()

LIQUID_CLASSES_DOC = """
Liquid classes define how aspirate and dispense behavior should be tuned for a given machine, head, and tip context.

What this area of the API is for:
- Listing liquid classes that match the current or requested context.
- Creating, updating, and deleting liquid class definitions.
- Managing aspirate, dispense, and equation fields that shape liquid-handling behavior.

Manual alignment:
- This corresponds to the idea that liquid handling depends on the physical setup and on liquid-specific behavior settings rather than only on raw volume.
- It complements the manual's discussion of speed, accuracy, and task behavior by making those settings explicit and reusable in software.

Selection behavior:
- The list endpoint first tries the active machine/head/tip context.
- If no match is found, it falls back through broader scopes until a usable class list is found.

PIPETTE_TECHNIQUES_DOC = """
Pipette techniques are reusable motion patterns layered onto aspirate and dispense operations.

What this area of the API is for:
- Listing saved techniques.
- Creating new techniques.
- Updating or deleting existing techniques.

Manual alignment:
- These techniques capture the kind of repeatable motion choices operators often associate with specialized liquid-handling behaviors, such as swirling or segmented movement.
- They provide a reusable configuration layer above the core task APIs.

Typical use cases:
- Defining a reusable swirl or circular motion.
- Reusing a technique across many aspirate or dispense calls.
- Editing motion parameters without changing task code.
""".strip()

DECK_DOC = """
Deck assignment endpoints control which labware is currently present at each Bravo location.

What this endpoint family is for:
- Assigning a labware definition to a deck location.
- Clearing a previously assigned location.
- Recording tip-box-specific metadata such as tip definition and fill state when relevant.

Manual alignment:
- This is the software equivalent of physically placing labware on the deck and making sure the software knows what is present before a run or diagnostic task.

Important behavior:
- Motion planning, visualization, compatibility checks, and task logic depend on accurate deck assignment.
- Tip boxes can carry additional metadata because tip pickup depends on both geometry and tip definition.

VISION_DOC = """
These endpoints expose the local distance-camera integration used to inspect the physical deck and support future camera-guided setup checks.

- Reporting camera SDK availability and calibration state.
- Starting or scaffolding camera calibration for the active machine.
- Comparing the expected PyBravo deck scene against the physical setup seen by the camera.
- Fetching preview information used for calibration and diagnostics.

Manual alignment:
- This is closest to the setup and diagnostics mindset in the Bravo manual, where the operator verifies that the physical deck, accessories, and handling geometry match the configured software state.
- The camera integration extends that idea with an external distance sensor so deck verification can be automated instead of relying only on visual inspection.

Important behavior:
- These endpoints depend on the vision feature being enabled in the active profile.
- They proxy to the local vision service rather than talking to the camera directly from the main API process.
- The current implementation supports calibration scaffolding and verification reporting even when live camera hardware is not yet fully available.

Returns the saved camera-to-deck calibration artifact used by the local vision service.

What this operation does:
- Loads the currently saved calibration payload for the active machine context.

VISION_CALIBRATION_RUN_DOC = """
Starts the guided calibration workflow, or when hardware is not yet ready, creates a calibration scaffold that can be completed later.

What this operation does:
- Sends the active machine identifier to the local vision service.
- Creates or updates a calibration record describing the intended camera mount and solve mode.
- Persists a scaffold so later capture/solve steps have a machine-specific starting point.

Manual alignment:
- This is analogous to the kind of guided setup and verification procedures described in the Bravo setup chapters, but for the external distance camera rather than for teachpoints or gripper setup.

Prerequisites:
- Vision must be enabled in the active profile.
- The local vision service must be reachable.

Typical use cases:
- First-time setup of the distance camera on a machine.
- Resetting or re-running calibration after the camera mount changes.
- Creating a placeholder calibration record before full hardware capture is available.

VISION_VERIFY_DOC = """
Verifies the physical deck setup against PyBravo's expected software model using the local distance-camera service.

- Returns a slot-by-slot report describing expected labware, observed status, and confidence.

Manual alignment:
- This directly supports the operator goal of confirming that the physical deck matches the configured software state before running tasks.
- It is the camera-assisted equivalent of manually verifying plates, tip boxes, and setup details during diagnostics or pre-run checks.

Prerequisites:
- Vision must be enabled in the active profile.
- Deck assignments and teachpoints should already reflect the intended physical setup.
- Calibration should exist if geometric verification is expected to be meaningful.
