"""Autofill station: the accessory-bus pump module and weigh pad.

These modules hang off the instrument's accessory bus, not a PC COM port. On
Darwin-generation instruments each command is a 9-byte serial payload that the
controller forwards (see ``DarwinController.send_serial``); the first byte of
the reply echoes the command and the second is a status byte (0 = OK).

Commands::

    AB 00                          detect accessory modules (sent once at init)
    AC mm pp dd ss ss              run pump pp on module mm, direction dd
                                   (1 forward, 0 reverse), speed ss ss as a
                                   little-endian uint16 in 0.01 % (0-10000)
    AE 00                          stop all pumps
    AF mm                          pump module status
    B3 mm                          read weigh pad mm; reply bytes 2-3 are the
                                   raw A/D value, little-endian uint16

Bytes not listed are zero. Reply bytes past the ones listed are left over from
earlier traffic and carry no meaning.

**A pump never stops on its own.** ``AC`` has no duration: the pump runs until
``AE`` arrives. Every run therefore goes through :meth:`AutofillStation.run_pumps`,
which arms a watchdog that sends the stop, and :meth:`close` stops anything
still running. Tare and range are host-side calibration only; the module just
reports raw A/D counts.

**Module errors fail closed.** The module also stops its pumps by itself when
the host stops polling it, so a module that answers with an error status (or
does not answer) during a run is not polled again: the run ends at once (new
run token, so the keepalive and any hold loop let go), the stop is sent at
most twice, the error is kept in :attr:`AutofillStation.last_error`, and the
bus is then left quiet for ``FAULT_QUIET_S`` so the module's own timeout can
stop the pumps even if it ignored the stop.

    * The drain follows a PI controller around "drain = inflow".
    * The inflow runs at the requested value while the drain has headroom and
      is scaled down continuously as the drain nears its limit (full inflow at
      ``throttle_from_pct`` drain, none at 100 %), so a drain that cannot keep
      up never lets the tray overflow and nothing switches on and off.
    * Pump speeds never jump: both move at most ``max_speed_change_pct_s``.

      ``prime_before_target_pct`` of the target the drain runs at full speed
